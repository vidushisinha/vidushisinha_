-->Problem Statement:-
Medical facilities are not available all over the India in proper way.
Unemployment.
Price of medical equipments are higher.
Patient does not able to reach right place at right time.
Sometimes itâ€™s a difficult task to find a medicines.

-->Proposed Solution:-
We are trying to make an app or webpage related to healthcare system (AVtook).
 The main motive of this app are as following:-
24/7 assistant for any healthcare advice.
Suggests hospital near by location related to your concern.
Emergency transportation service provided.
Online home based medicine delivery system.

-->Atmanirbhar Bharat:-
Made in India app.
Provides employment as a part of medicine delivery system and emergency transportation.
Low cost medical equipments were manufactured in India itself as a small scale startups , we can sponsoring it on our app. (for e.g; ventilators which were imported from foreign countries costs 22lakhs but in India some of them developed on around 2-3 thousands, so we can promote this kind of startups.)
With the help of this idea, we improve the healthcare system of India.

These are the basic points which makes India Atmanirbhar.
